This is an example DSP node that is simply passing buffers back and forth.

= Preparation =

In order to develop dynamic dsp nodes you'll need a C6x compiler and doffbuild
tools.

== C6x compiler ==

Download from:
https://www-a.ti.com/downloads/sds_support/targetcontent/LinuxDspTools/download.html

Install to '/opt/dsptools'

== doffbuild ==

The only relevant tool is DLLcreate, which can be found in TI's omapzoom site,
on the dspbridge_dsp package.

 mkdir -p tmp
 tar -xf dspbridge_dsp.tar.gz -C tmp
 mv tmp/dsp/bdsptools/packages/ti/dspbridge/dsp/doffbuild /opt/doffbuild
 rm -rf tmp

= libdspbridge =

This library is used by the user-space applications.

 git clone git://github.com/felipec/libdspbridge.git
 cd libdspbridge
 make DESTDIR=$rootfs install

= Build =

 make DSP_TOOLS=/opt/dsptools DSP_DOFFBUILD=/opt/doffbuild BRIDGE_DIR=../libdspbridge

As a result you'll have two binaries; 'dummy.dll64P' for dsp-side, and 'dummy' for arm-side.

To load the dynamic node:

/dspbridge/dynreg.out -r /lib/dsp/dummy.dll64P

Now you can run the dummy test application.
